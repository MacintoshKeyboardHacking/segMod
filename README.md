Welcome!  This project contains a mixture of reverse-engineered documentation, Python and C code, with some hardware ESP32 and Raspberry Pi modifications to my Segway GT3 Pro scooter.  The same should apply to other models of the 'x3 series' ZT3, G3 Max, F3...  https://github.com/MacintoshKeyboardHacking/segMod/wiki

myBLE2 is the latest project, an ESP32 based replacement for the display module which provides additional vehicle customization.

As always work is ongoing; for discussion and demonstration see my youtube https://www.youtube.com/@MacintoshKeyboardHacking/streams
