another MacintoshKeyboardHacking creation...

myBLE.py is a Raspberry Pi based replacement for the Segway BLE "dashboard" display module present in GT3 series scooters, and should be easily adapted to other models in the "3" series (F3 Pro, G3 Max, ZT3) and probably older models as well.

It provides the functionality necessary to get the Segway VCU into "drive" mode and stream realtime vehicle performance parameters - speed, battery, distance, etc.  Currently I'm viewing them over an ssh session, but attaching an I2C display seems like the next logical step
